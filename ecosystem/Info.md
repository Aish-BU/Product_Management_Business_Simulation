This flowchart represents the complete lifecycle of the AD 715 Business Simulation — integrating students, instructors, AI assistance, and cloud infrastructure into a seamless digital learning ecosystem.

Roles & Collaboration:
Students run simulations, instructors review outcomes, AI Copilot generates insights, and admins oversee Azure-based infrastructure and compliance.

Workflow Overview:
Login → Select Functional Area → Input Decisions → Run Simulation → Generate Reports → Apply AI Insights → Instructor Feedback → Continuous Iteration.

System Architecture:
Built with Django (frontend), Python-based simulation engine, PostgreSQL database, Power BI dashboards, and Bing Copilot prompts for intelligent recommendations.

Data & Cloud Backbone:
Deployed on Azure Virtual Machines with CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions, live telemetry monitoring, and Power BI integration for performance analytics.

Governance & Impact:
Ensures data privacy, academic integrity, and transparent feedback cycles while enabling measurable student performance and adaptive learning through AI-driven insights.

In essence: This architecture transforms a traditional Excel simulation into a scalable, cloud-hosted, AI-augmented decision-making platform that bridges education, analytics, and automation.
